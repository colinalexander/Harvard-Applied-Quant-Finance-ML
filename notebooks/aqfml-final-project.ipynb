    "This case study examines how increasing data richness affects the behavior and usability of machine-learning signals in equity factor portfolios. Using Fama–French 100 Size×Book-to-Market portfolios at daily frequency over a 35-year window, the analysis compares linear and nonlinear models under a leakage-aware walk-forward framework, evaluating both cross-sectional ranking performance and realized portfolio outcomes after transaction costs.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Three findings are particularly relevant for practitioners.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, expanding both the cross-section and the frequency of the data environment improves the stability of ranking signals relative to small, monthly portfolio panels, but does not eliminate meaningful differences across model classes. Across all specifications, daily Information Coefficients (ICs) are modest in magnitude—on the order of 0.5–1.0%—yet consistently positive, indicating economically meaningful but noisy cross-sectional structure. Importantly, richer data does not mechanically favor more flexible models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, nonlinear models capture some interaction-driven structure, but their advantages are incremental rather than transformative. Random Forests and a shallow neural network exhibit ranking performance comparable to linear baselines, while boosted trees perform worse once evaluated under the same walk-forward protocol, feature set, and target horizon. These results suggest that, in a high-frequency portfolio setting with disciplined feature construction, linear factor structure remains dominant and additional model flexibility does not guarantee stronger ranking signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Third, translating signals into implementable portfolios materially changes conclusions drawn from predictive metrics alone. Models with similar or even higher ranking skill can underperform economically once turnover and transaction costs are applied. In this setting, the linear baseline combines modest but stable ranking performance with low turnover, resulting in comparatively robust net outcomes. More flexible models—including boosted trees—generate less stable rankings and higher trading intensity, leading to inferior net performance across realistic transaction cost assumptions.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Overall, the case illustrates that data scale, model choice, and portfolio implementation interact tightly in practice. Improving any single component in isolation—whether by adding data, increasing model flexibility, or optimizing predictive metrics—does not ensure usable results. Practical value depends on how signals behave when deployed under realistic constraints, where turnover, stability, and robustness often matter more than incremental gains in raw predictive accuracy.\n",

    "Equity factor models form a core building block of systematic investing. By grouping stocks according to characteristics such as size, value, profitability, and momentum, factor portfolios provide a structured and interpretable way to study return behavior across the cross-section of equities. Traditionally, these models are evaluated using linear regressions on **monthly data**, a choice that balances noise reduction, interpretability, and statistical convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, advances in machine learning have raised the possibility that **nonlinear models** can capture interaction effects and state-dependent behavior that linear factor frameworks may miss. Tree-based ensembles and neural networks, in particular, offer flexible approximations that can adapt to heterogeneous relationships across assets. However, their usefulness in asset pricing remains contested, in part because financial return data are noisy, low signal-to-noise, and sensitive to evaluation choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central challenge in this debate is **data scale**. When models are applied to small portfolio panels at low frequency, it is difficult to disentangle genuine structure from estimation noise. Poor performance by more flexible models may reflect insufficient data, objective mismatch, or instability under realistic implementation, rather than fundamental limitations of the models themselves. Conversely, apparent gains in predictive metrics may fail to survive once signals are translated into portfolios and exposed to trading frictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study examines that tension by holding the historical window fixed while **scaling the data environment**. Specifically, it moves from small, monthly portfolio panels to a richer setting using **Fama–French 100 Size×Book-to-Market portfolios at daily frequency over approximately 35 years**. This expansion increases both cross-sectional breadth and temporal resolution, providing a more demanding and informative environment in which to assess model behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is framed from a practitioner’s perspective. Rather than asking which model is “best” in an abstract sense, the case focuses on how different modeling choices behave when evaluated through **ranking performance and portfolio outcomes**, including turnover and transaction costs. The objective is to understand the trade-offs that emerge as data scale increases and to clarify which conclusions are robust once signals are deployed under realistic constraints.\n",

The underlying factor definitions and economic interpretations are summarized in <a id=\"ref-a\" href=\"#appendix-a\"><strong>Appendix&nbsp;A</strong></a>.\n",

This framing allows signals to be ranked across portfolios and translated into long–short allocations without relying on security-level data.\n",

The higher frequency increases the number of observations available for model estimation and evaluation, while also introducing additional noise and short-term volatility.

    "The modeling approach compares a small set of **representative linear and nonlinear methods** that are commonly used in applied quantitative finance. The goal is not to exhaust the model space, but to contrast how different levels of flexibility behave as the data environment becomes richer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a linear baseline, the analysis uses **Ridge regression**. Ridge preserves the interpretability of linear factor models while stabilizing estimation through regularization, making it a natural benchmark for assessing whether additional model complexity delivers incremental value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce nonlinearity, the primary nonlinear benchmark is a **Random Forest**. Random Forests capture interaction effects and conditional relationships through ensembles of decision trees while retaining robustness through averaging. In prior factor studies, tree-based models have often proven effective in low- to moderate-dimensional settings, making them a useful reference point for evaluating nonlinear structure in portfolio returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **shallow neural network** is also included as a sensitivity check. Neural networks offer a more flexible function class than tree ensembles, but are known to be sensitive to data scale, noise, and objective choice in financial applications. Here, the network is intentionally kept simple and is not treated as a primary contender; instead, it provides context for how highly flexible models behave when applied to portfolio-level return prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are trained using rolling walk-forward estimation to preserve temporal ordering and avoid look-ahead bias. Scale-sensitive models—Ridge regression and the neural network—use feature standardization fit within each training window and applied consistently to subsequent periods. All models are trained using mean-squared error for numerical stability, while evaluation focuses on **cross-sectional ranking performance**, measured by the Information Coefficient (Spearman correlation).\n",
    "\n",
    "This mismatch between the training objective and the evaluation metric is common in applied settings and is noted here because it can influence relative model behavior, particularly for neural networks. Accordingly, neural network results are interpreted cautiously and primarily as indicators of sensitivity rather than definitive evidence of superiority. The emphasis remains on how different model classes respond to increased data scale and how their signals behave once translated into portfolios.\n",

Ridge regression delivers the strongest and most stable signal, consistent with the persistence of linear factor structure in the FF100 universe.

At a daily horizon, realized returns are dominated by transitory noise, leading to mechanically smaller IC values even when underlying ranking information is present. Longer-horizon evaluations benefit from return aggregation and partial noise cancellation, which can amplify the measured strength of persistent signals. This perspective helps reconcile why increased observation counts and richer cross-sections do not necessarily translate into dominant daily IC gains for more flexible models.\n",

    "<strong>Interpretation.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Across models, the contrast between **gross** and **net** performance highlights the role of trading frictions in translating ranking signals into realized outcomes. While all models experience performance degradation once transaction costs are applied, the magnitude of this effect varies meaningfully with turnover and signal stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear baseline exhibits comparatively low turnover and more resilient net performance, despite only modest advantages in ranking metrics. Random Forest and neural network signals generate higher turnover, which erodes gross performance once costs are imposed and leads to weaker net outcomes over the full sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boosted-tree model illustrates this trade-off most starkly. Although its signal-level diagnostics indicate persistent positive ranking information, higher turnover and signal instability result in inferior net portfolio performance across all transaction cost assumptions considered. This outcome reinforces the central message of the analysis: improvements in predictive metrics do not guarantee economic value when implementation frictions are taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing these portfolio results to the signal-level diagnostics in <a href=\"#section-6\"><strong>Section&nbsp;6</strong></a>, the <strong>relative ordering</strong> observed in Information Coefficients does not fully survive implementation. Although nonlinear models can exhibit competitive ranking performance in certain periods, differences in gross portfolio outcomes and signal stability are amplified once trading frictions are imposed. The linear baseline remains comparatively robust, combining moderate signal strength with low turnover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these results illustrate that economic relevance depends not only on ranking quality, but also on the consistency with which rankings translate into implementable portfolios. Portfolio implementation therefore acts as a stringent filter on model outputs, distinguishing between signals that are informative in isolation and those that remain effective under realistic trading constraints.\n",

    "The portfolio results highlight several trade-offs that are not apparent from signal diagnostics alone. While ranking metrics such as the Information Coefficient provide a useful first screen, **implementation frictions materially shape realized outcomes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key dimension is **turnover**. More flexible models tend to generate rankings that change more frequently, particularly in higher-frequency data. Even when such models exhibit positive and persistent ranking information, elevated turnover can erode returns once transaction costs are applied. In the present setting, this effect is most clearly illustrated by the boosted-tree model, which produces competitive signal diagnostics but underperforms economically due to higher trading intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, more stable models may sacrifice some predictive sharpness but benefit from lower turnover and more resilient net performance. The linear baseline exemplifies this trade-off, combining modest ranking strength with implementation efficiency and robustness across transaction cost assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important consideration is **signal stability**. Cumulative return paths indicate that short bursts of strong performance are often followed by periods of degradation, particularly for models with unstable rankings and higher turnover. From a practical standpoint, strategies that deliver smoother performance profiles—even at the cost of lower peak returns—may be preferable to those that alternate between strong gains and rapid reversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these results underscore that **model evaluation cannot be separated from portfolio construction**. Decisions about model complexity, data frequency, and rebalancing cadence jointly determine whether a signal remains usable once deployed. Improving predictive metrics in isolation does not guarantee better outcomes if those improvements come at the expense of higher turnover or instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For practitioners, the implication is clear: selecting a modeling approach requires balancing signal strength against implementation costs and robustness. The most effective models in this setting are not necessarily those that maximize ranking metrics, but those whose signals remain **stable, interpretable, and economical to trade**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because IC measures relative ranking rather than payoff magnitude, even stable positive IC does not guarantee attractive net portfolio returns once turnover and costs are introduced. This distinction becomes increasingly important as model complexity and signal responsiveness increase.\n",

    "\n",
    "As an exploratory extension, this section briefly considers **boosted tree models** as an alternative nonlinear approach. While Random Forests rely on bagging—averaging many decorrelated trees—boosted trees build ensembles **sequentially**, with each tree focusing on residual errors from prior iterations. In applied settings, boosting is often viewed as a middle ground between linear models and more flexible architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boosted-tree implementation follows the same data, feature set, and walk-forward evaluation used throughout the case. Models are evaluated under the identical rolling training protocol, prediction horizon, and portfolio construction rules as the baseline specifications. Model complexity is deliberately constrained, using shallow tree depth and conservative learning rates to limit overfitting. The objective is to assess **behavioral differences**, not to optimize performance through extensive tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluated under this fully consistent framework, boosted trees do not outperform the baseline models. Although they produce positive ranking signals, their average Information Coefficient is lower than that of the linear and other nonlinear benchmarks, and their signals exhibit higher turnover. As a result, boosted trees generate inferior net portfolio performance once transaction costs are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "This outcome illustrates a broader point about model flexibility in high-frequency portfolio settings. Sequential fitting can amplify short-term responsiveness, but this responsiveness often manifests as unstable rankings and elevated trading intensity. As with other nonlinear models, any incremental gains in raw signal sharpness must be weighed against implementation costs and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this robustness check reinforces the central message of the case: **model class alone does not determine usability**. Even powerful nonlinear methods can underperform economically when increased flexibility leads to unstable signals or excessive trading. Boosted trees may warrant further exploration in alternative data regimes or with different objectives, but in the present setting they do not alter the trade-offs highlighted in the main analysis.\n",
